### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Rio Jos, the developer who owns a blog called [decodedHTML](decodedhtml.com). I am in the journey of building my portfolio. 

I use NodeJS & Rust for tinkering. I'm currently building a FOSS side-project. I want to create a portfolio of FOSS side-projects. Mainly for my source code to exist for anyone, anytime, freely, forever.

I can create cool backend prototypes. And I'm doing a Bachelor in Computer Application (ongoing).
